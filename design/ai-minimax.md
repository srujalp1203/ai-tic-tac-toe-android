# AI Design: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible future board states.

## Key Concepts

- Recursive evaluation of game states
- Utility scoring for win, loss, and draw
- Alpha-Beta pruning to reduce search space

## Difficulty Control

Difficulty levels are implemented by limiting search depth:

- Easy: Shallow search depth
- Hard: Deeper recursive evaluation

This ensures both optimal play and adjustable challenge.
